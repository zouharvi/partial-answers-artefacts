# Learning from Data - Final project

Solutions of me (Vil√©m) and Edu for 2021/2022 course Learning from Data at RUG (Rijksuniversiteit Groningen).

## Running the code

Run `make data_all` to load the data into `data/final/COP.clean.json`.

## TODO
- Joint models:
  - BERT-based with independent classification "heads"
  - BERT-based with predictions being individual tokens (early exit)
- Individual models:
  - BERT-based with single classification "head"
  - BERT-based with first token begin the prediction (early exit)
  - baseline models

## Repository structure
