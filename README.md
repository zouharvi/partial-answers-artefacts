Work-in-Progress exploration of Fusion of Partial Answers as Artefacts for Multi-Task Classification.
Authors: Vil√©m Zouhar, Edu Vallejo Arguinzoniz.

## Running the code

### Preparation

- Install dependencies with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- Run `make data_all` to load the data into `data/final/clean.json` and prepare all other crafted data (may require up to 15GB of disk space)

### Models

- TODO

<!-- ## TODO
- Individual models:
  - BERT-based with single classification "head"
  - BERT-based with first token begin the prediction (early exit)
  - baseline models
- Joint models:
  - BERT-based with independent classification "heads"
  - BERT-based with predictions being individual tokens (early exit) -->
